##meal template
* composed of [meal components]
* can be assigned to a [calendar day] ahead of time

##Calendar
* this is a necessary bit of complexity for making a plan
* use google calendar, perhaps, as a start
    * let this be interoperable with calendering services des autres
##as an aside...
* there is an ungodly analogue between music and writing
    * a masterwork of fiction and a master orchestral composition
        * require similar coordination 
            * of elements
            * of timelines
            * of elements' attributes
            * of conflicts
    * decent applications should sound at least as good as pop
